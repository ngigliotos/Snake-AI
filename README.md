# Snake-AI
This was inspired by Code Bullet. I made a snake AI that perfects the game snake by following a randomized Hamiltonian path. The program generates the path and then the snake moves in a somewhat optimized version of that path until it gets to a certain size. As it gets bigger it follows the path more closely and eventually sticks to the path entirely to win.
