# Snake-AI
This was inspired by Code Bullet. I made a snake AI that perfects the game snake by following a randomized Hamiltonian path. The program generates the path and then the snake moves in a somewhat optimized version of that path until it gets to a certain size. As it gets bigger it follows the path more closely and eventually sticks to the path entirely to win. The biggest limitation is that the snake does die about 1 in every 10 or so runs so the algorthim is not flawless yet. The API pygame is required to use the program as that is what I made the game snake in. It is linked below
