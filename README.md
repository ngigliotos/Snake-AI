# Snake-AI
This was inspired by Code Bullet. The goal was to make a snake AI that can perfect the game snake by following a Hamiltonian path. This was too trivial however so I made it harder by attempting to randomize the path and allow the snake AI to cut corners resulting is a faster better game but making it possible for the snake to die. The program generates the path and then the snake moves in a somewhat optimized version of that path until it gets to a certain size. As it gets bigger it follows the path more closely and eventually sticks to the path entirely to win. The biggest limitation is that the snake does die about 1 in every 5 or so runs so the algorthim is not flawless yet. The API pygame is required to use the program as that is what I made the game snake in. It is linked below
